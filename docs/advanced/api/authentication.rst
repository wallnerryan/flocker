Authentication
==============

The Flocker REST API uses TLS to secure and authenticate requests.
This ensures an API request is both encrypted, and verified to have come from an authorised user, while the corresponding response is verified to have come from the genuine cluster control service.

Certificates are used for both client and server authentication, entirely replacing the use of usernames and passwords commonly used in HTTPS.

Therefore to grant a user access to your cluster's REST API, you will need to use the ``flocker-ca`` tool, installed as part of the ``flocker-cli`` package, to generate a certificate and private key that is then given to the API end user.
To give a user access to a cluster's REST API, use the ``flocker-ca`` tool to generate a certificate and private key for the user.
The ``flocker-ca`` tool is installed as part of the flocker-cli package.
If you have not already followed these steps, see the :doc:`flocker-node installation instructions <../../indepth/installation>`.

Generate an API user certificate
================================

The CLI package includes the ``flocker-ca`` program which is used to generate certificate and key files.

You can run ``flocker-ca --help`` for a full list of available commands. For API user certificates, run the ``flocker-ca create-api-certificate`` command from the same directory containing the certificate authority files generated when you first :ref:`installed the cluster <authentication>`.

Run ``flocker-ca create-api-certificate <username>``, where ``<username>`` is a unique username for an API user.

.. code-block:: console

   $ flocker-ca create-api-certificate alice
   Created alice.crt and alice.key. You can now give these to your API end user so they can access the control service API.

The two files generated will correspond to the username you specified in the command, in this example ``alice.crt`` and ``alice.key``.
You should securely provide a copy of these files to the API end user, as well as a copy of the cluster's public certificate, the ``cluster.crt`` file.

Using an API certificate to authenticate
========================================

Once in possession of an API user certificate and the cluster certificate, an end user must authenticate with those certificates in every request to the cluster REST API - the cluster certificate ensures the user is connecting to the genuine API of their cluster, while the client certificate allows the API server to ensure the request is from a genuine, authorised user.
An example of performing this authentication with ``cURL`` is given below, where ``172.16.255.250`` represents the IP address of the control service.
The following is an example of an authenticated request to create a new container on a cluster.

.. code-block:: console

   $ curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST -d '{"host": "172.255.250.251", "name": "webserver", "image": "nginx:latest"}' --cacert cluster.crt --cert alice.crt --key alice.key https://172.16.255.250/v1/configuration/containers
