What's New
==========

.. note:: If you already have a tutorial environment from a previous release see :ref:`upgrading-vagrant-environment`.

.. note:: If you already have an old version of ``flocker-cli`` installed, delete the install script and directory before installing the newer version.

* Added support for `Fig`_ compatible :ref:`application configuration <fig-compatible-config>` files.


v0.2
====

Everything is new since this is our first release.


Known Limitations
=================

* This release is not ready for production and should not be used on publicly accessible servers or to store data you care about.
  Backwards compatibility is not a goal yet.
* Changes to the application configuration file will often not be noticed by ``flocker-deploy``, and there is no way to delete applications or volumes.
  Choose new names for your applications if you are making changes to the application configuration.

You can learn more about where we might be going with future releases by:

* Stopping by the ``#clusterhq`` channel on ``irc.freenode.net``.
* Visiting our GitHub repository at https://github.com/ClusterHQ/flocker.
* Reading :doc:`../roadmap/index`.
