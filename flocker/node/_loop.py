"""
Convergence loop for a node-specific dataset agent.

In practice most of the code is generic, but a few bits assume this agent
is node-specific.

The convergence agent runs a loop that attempts to converge the local
state with the desired configuration as transmitted by the control
service. This involves two state machines: ClusterStatus and ConvergenceLoop.
The ClusterStatus state machine receives inputs from the connection to the
control service, and sends inputs to the ConvergenceLoop state machine.
